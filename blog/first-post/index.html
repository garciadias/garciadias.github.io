  <p>Hearing podcasts is a great way of giving some use of your traveling time. It is also great to distract you of boring activities like doing the dishes or vacuum cleaning. Since I hear podcasts from many years now and often people ask for suggestions of what to follow I decided to do this post.</p>
<h2>Podcast players:</h2>
<p>Most podcast players are similar. I have tried at least six of them:</p>

</div><p>The most noticeable ones are the <strong>podcast addict</strong> and the <strong>Spotify</strong>. The Spotify can be a great option for people who are starting to hear podcasts and already use Spotify to listen to music. The biggest problems with Spotify is that many podcasts are not in the platform and that you rely on your connection if you don’t have a premium account. Normally, podcast players use RSS feeds to track podcast producers. With this they can gather podcasts uploaded in different platforms. Spotify needs that the podcast producer uploads their content to the Spotify, so it is possible that they don’t and you will lose their content. Another problem is that you can only download episodes if you have a premium account, so if you are in the tube or anywhere without connection you will not be able to listen to your show. Other players download your feed when you are on wifi and you can listen to it later without the need of internet connection.</p>
<p>I will not give a review of the others. I have tried them some time ago and I am not sure they haven’t changed. The one I use now is the podcast addict. I prefer it mainly because it gives me the possibility of searching by episode titles. It helps a lot when I’m interested in a particular subject or I want to discover new podcasts. The podcast titles and descriptions are not always accurate and categories like “politics” or “culture” are too broad.</p>
<p>This is a short list with a brief description of each of them.</p>
<div class="centered padding-bottom">

    <p><b>Data stories</b></p>

    <p>Data stories is a podcast about design and data visualization. In this show the hosts interview people that have made awesome visualization projects and ask them about their mental process and the techniques used.</p>
